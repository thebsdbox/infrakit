[InfraKit](https://github.com/docker/infrakit) plugins for creating and managing resources in Google Cloud Platform.

## Instance plugin

An InfraKit instance plugin which creates Google Compute Engine instances.

### Building

To build the instance plugin, run `make binaries`.  The plugin binary will be located at
`./build/infrakit-instance-gcp`.

### Running

```bash
${PATH_TO_INFRAKIT}/infrakit-flavor-vanilla
${PATH_TO_INFRAKIT}/infrakit-group-default
./build/infrakit-instance-gcp --project=[GCP_PROJECT] --zone=[GCP_ZONE]

${PATH_TO_INFRAKIT}/infrakit group commit gcp-example-1.json
```

#### Project and zone selection

Google Cloud project and zone can be passed on the command line with `--project`
and `--zone`. In case a value is not provided, the plugin will fallback to:
 + Querying the [Metadata server][metadata] when running on GCE
 + `CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT` and `CLOUDSDK_CORE_ZONE` environment variables

#### Pets versus Cattle

Groups defined with an `Allocation/Size` will create 'cattle' instances that
are fully disposable. When an instance is deleted, a completely new one will be
recreated. this new instance will have a different name and a different disk.

Groups defined with an `Allocation/LogicalIDs` will create 'pet' instances.
When an instance is deleted, a new one will be created, with the same name. It
will also try to reuse the disk named after the instance if it was not deleted
too.

### Example configuration

```json
{
  "ID": "gcp-example-1",
  "Properties": {
    "Allocation": {
      "Size": 1
    },
    "Instance": {
      "Plugin": "instance-gcp",
      "Properties": {
        "NamePrefix": "test",
        "Description": "Test of GCP infrakit",
        "Network": "default",
        "Tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
        "MachineType": "n1-standard-1",
        "Disks":[{
            "Boot": true,
            "SizeGb": 60,
            "Image": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ubuntu-os-cloud/global/images/ubuntu-1404-trusty-v20161205",
            "Type": "pd-standard"
        }],
        "Scopes": [
          "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloudruntimeconfig",
          "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write"
        ]
      }
    },
    "Flavor": {
      "Plugin": "flavor-vanilla",
      "Properties": {
        "Init": [
          "sh -c \"echo 'Hello, World!' > /hello\""
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Group plugin

An InfraKit group plugin which wraps Google Compute Engine's managed instance
groups.

### Building

To build the group plugin, run `make binaries`.  The plugin binary will be located at
`./build/infrakit-group-gcp`.

### Running

```bash
${PATH_TO_INFRAKIT}/infrakit-flavor-vanilla
./build/infrakit-instance-gcp --project=[GCP_PROJECT] --zone=[GCP_ZONE] --name=group

${PATH_TO_INFRAKIT}/infrakit group commit gcp-example-2.json
```

#### Project and zone selection

Works the same as the instance plugin.

#### Pets versus Cattle

This plugin supports only pets via `Allocation/Size`. It doesn't support
`Allocation/LogicalIDs`.
This plugin doesn't need an instance plugin since instances are managed directly
by GCP.

### Example configuration

```json
{
  "ID": "gcp-example-2",
  "Properties": {
    "Allocation": {
      "Size": 2
    },
    "Instance": {
      "Properties": {
        "Description": "Test of GCP infrakit",
        "Network": "default",
        "Tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
        "MachineType": "n1-standard-1",
        "Disks":[{
            "Boot": true,
            "SizeGb": 60,
            "Image": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ubuntu-os-cloud/global/images/ubuntu-1404-trusty-v20161205",
            "Type": "pd-standard",
            "AutoDelete": false,
            "ReuseExisting": true
        }],
        "Scopes": [
          "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloudruntimeconfig",
          "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write"
        ]
      }
    },
    "Flavor": {
      "Plugin": "flavor-vanilla",
      "Properties": {
        "Init": [
          "sh -c \"echo 'Hello, World!' > /hello\""
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
